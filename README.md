SO, basically I am currently taking the Fast.ai 's "Practical Deep Learning for Coders" Courses. 
In that course we are encouraged to use what we learned about Deep Learning into practical use. To achieve that goal, 
I have created a model (AI 'cus more clickbaityÂ ;) ) that can classify an Image between "Amy Adams" or "Isla Fisher".
With help of Flask( a microframework for Python) we are going to create a web application on which a user will upload an Image, 
and model will make prediction to tell who's that Image is.
